                    Many Americans have saved money in their 401(k) for their entire lives and can be one of their 
                    largest assets for retirement. The tax advantages and portability of the 401(k) have provided many 
                    Americans with the ability to build a sizeable and important nest egg. The flexibility these plans 
                    provide give you choices as you go through life but make sure you know the rules of the rollovers as 
                    mistakes can be costly!
