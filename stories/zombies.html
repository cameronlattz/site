<h1>Chapter 1: John</h1>
<p>	It was another slow
day. Nobody ever came into the pawn shop when it was raining as hard
as it was today. John was considering closing up early, but he knew
home would be no less boring than the shop. No one was waiting for
him there.</p>
<p>	John was moving
some items from the back of the store when the bells on the door
chimed.</p>
<p>	&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo;
he thought, &ldquo;I was sure there wouldn't be anyone in today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>	&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;welcome to&ndash; &rdquo;</p>
<p>	He stopped. The man
who had stumbled into his shop was now lying on the ground in a pool
of his own blood. He moaned in what Jack was sure was pain.</p>
<p>	&ldquo;God!&rdquo;
John yelled. &ldquo;Are you ok?!&rdquo; He fumbled for the store's
phone to call an ambulance.</p>
<p>	As John grabbed the phone by the register, he turned back
to check on the bloodied man who had been lying in the doorway. The injured man had
stood up.</p>
<p>	Most of his
intestines were on the floor, and the rest were hanging out of his
stomach.</p>
<p>	&ldquo;Holy&ndash;
are you ok?!&rdquo; John asked again, shocked.</p>
<p>	The man didn't seem
to notice that his guts were missing. He seemed to care only about
Jack, and was making his way clumsily toward him.</p>
<p>	&ldquo;Whoa&ndash; 
stay there. Don't move. You're gonna hurt yourself,&rdquo; John said
as the strange man came closer.</p>
<p>	John was quickly
becoming more concerned for his own safety than the injured man's. He
began circling around the counter, keeping the mass of wood and glass
between himself and the man.</p>
<p>	He realized he
still had the phone in his hand and he called 911. There was no dial
tone. He tried again and again, to no avail. He had never wanted to
see a police officer as badly as he did now; well, except for one
other time.</p>
<p>	John was becoming
increasingly desperate by the minute. He could not dodge the man for
hours, and he would certainly not allow this obviously drugged-up man
to rob his store. He told himself that the man would certainly die
anyway &ndash; nobody can survive without their intestines. So, when
the opportunity presented itself, he ran to the front of the store
and grabbed a baseball bat.</p>
<p>	&ldquo;Get out now!
I will use this!&rdquo; John warned.</p>
<p>	The man did not
listen. He kept moving toward John.</p>
<p>	John swung his bat
and connected with the man's thigh. The man fell down but immediately
rose back up, no pain showing in his face or all-white eyes.</p>
<p>	John was stunned.
How could he be walking still? And without a limp?</p>
<p>	John followed with
more strikes to the legs, arms, and eventually the man's chest. They
barely slowed the man down.</p>
<p>	John, now in a
frenzy, swung at the man's head. This seemed to stun the man, and he
fell down. Yet, he started to rise again. As he did, Jack brought the
bat down on the man's skull a little harder than he had meant to.</p>
<p>	The man's skull
split open with a sickening crack and gray bits of brain burst out in
a shower of blood.</p>
<p>	John emptied his
stomach, leaving that afternoon's lunch on the shop floor next to the
finally-dead man's body.</p>
<p>	He ran outside to
call for help. What he saw was chaos.</p>
<p>	Men, women, and
children fled from people with horrible wounds and those same angry
white eyes that John had seen on the man in his store. John knew he
had to get out of here.</p>
<p>	He ran inside to
grab his bat, and paused long enough to grab his two finest swords &ndash;
Angelsword-forged katanas, each over two feet in blade length and as
sharp as a razor.</p>
<p>	He knew where he
had to go. Not back home, no, he had nothing there that could help.
He had to go to the one place he knew could survive this horror.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: Remington Arms Co.</h1>
<p>He parked his car in a parking lot that seemed much emptier than he had ever remembered it being. He had assumed most of his 
former co-workers would have stayed here to protect themselves from the horrors outside, but now he realized that most had families 
and would probably have left to find them.</p>
<p>He walked up to the front doors and noticed that the large glass doors had been shattered. He stepped through one of the broken 
doors.</p>
<p>The lobby was deserted. He walked up to the elevator, but the button would not light up. The power had probably been cut. He took 
the stairs to the fourth floor, which held the design laboratory and testing room. He pushed on the door but found it locked shut.</p>
<p>"Open up! It's John Weston!" He shouted, banging on the door.</p>
<p>No response. He banged again, harder this time. Finally, he turned his back to the door and sank to the floor, leaning against the 
door. Where would he go now?</p>
<p>He jumped back up as he heard footsteps approach the door. Chains rattled as the person on the other side removed the lock keeping 
the doors shut.</p>
<p>"Richard!" John said, seeing his old friend for the first time in years.</p>
<p>"Hello, John," Richard said, not sounding too excited to see him.</p>
<p>"Where's everyone else?" John asked.</p>
<p>"Look for yourself," Richard replied, pointing to the floor behind him.</p>
<p>Lying all over the floor, some in piles, some alone, were bodies. Pools of red blood covered the otherwise white tiled floor.</p>
<p>"Oh my God...what happened here?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know already? The dead are coming back to life and attacking the living."</p>
<p>"What? How is that possible!?"</p>
<p>"I don't fucking know, John! I'm an engineer, not a fucking doctor!"</p>
<p>John looked at his friend in shock. Had the years changed him this much? Or was it these horrible recent events? He had never 
known Richard to curse, or even speak in anger.</p>
<p>Richard sighed. "I'm sorry John. It's just...I got bit."</p>
<p>"Let me see," John said.</p>
<p>Richard turned his arm to show a 3-inch gash under his left elbow.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look bad. You'll be OK."</p>
<p>"No John...where have you been? A bite is fatal. Dawkins got bit on the ankle and he turned just a few hours later. That's how 
this," he said, sweeping his arm toward the bodies on the floor, "happened. We had this floor secured from the dead but he after he 
turned he got us at night while most of us were sleeping."</p>
<p>John noticed now that Richard seemed pale.</p>
<p>"God...I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p>There was a silence for a while, and then John said: "Maybe the hospitals are still open. Have you heard anything on the radio?" 
John had tried his car radio on the trip to the factory but had heard only static.</p>
<p>"The radio went out this morning. The Army was fighting hordes in all the major cities but they weren't doing so well."</p>
<p>"Not even the Army?"</p>
<p>"Not even them. It's the end of the world, John."</p>
<p>"I can't believe that. It might be the end of you and me, and this city, but I have to believe that there will be some people who 
stay alive long enough to wait out this...plague."</p>
<p>"John, you haven't seen what I've seen. There's just too many of them, and more every day. No place is safe."</p>
<p>"I thought this place would be safe."</p>
<p>"Yeah, so did everybody else. And maybe it would have been, until we ran out of food, had we known how this thing worked. There 
were hundreds of people here. We kept them out of this room because we didn't want them to see our prototypes. Imagine that, 
protecting company secrets when there's no company left."</p>
<p>"What happened to them?"</p>
<p>"Dawkins went to check on them right after dawn yesterday. They were all dead. They swarmed him. He managed to kill a few, but he 
got bit on the ankle. We didn't know a bite was a death sentence at the time."</p>
<p>"God...maybe you should have given them some guns."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't have mattered John. They're fast and strong and it takes a headshot to put them down. But the real problem is there's 
just too many of them. Not even you could kill all the dead fuckers out there. You can't find enough bullets for the job."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't need to shoot them all, just the ones who are trying to kill me. But, I don't have a gun. That's one of the reasons I 
came here."</p>
<p>"You? No gun? Well, I guess after what happened I can't blame you. We've got plenty of guns, but I'm afraid we're short on 
ammo."</p>
<p>Richard led him to the lab.</p>
<p>"This one's almost completely silent," Richard said, picking up a pistol with a long, oval-shaped muzzle, "but it's not very 
accurate. Takes 22s."</p>
<p>"This is our newest sniper rifle. Can take out a man from a mile away." Richard said, holding a long rifle.</p>
<p>"What's so special about that? Plenty of snipers can do that."</p>
<p>"With 9mm ammo?"</p>
<p>"Wow. That's incredible." (REWRITE AND INSERT COMMENT ABOUT REMINGTON IMPROVING SINCE JOHNS DAY)</p>
<p>"The rest is pretty standard stuff. I don't think I have to explain any of it to you. Take whatever you like - God knows I won't 
be needing any of it."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Richard. Do you mind if I stay here with you?"</p>
<p>"Sure, you can stay here. But not with me. I'm going to shoot myself in an hour."</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>"I'm bit, John. There's no way I'm going to become one of those bastards. I'm going to end it on my terms."</p>
<p>"Richard..."</p>
<p>"Please, save it. Nobody is going to survive this anyway. Nobody has the food, ammo, and shelter to manage it. You'll die too, 
just not as soon as I do."</p>
<p>John said nothing. He looked at his old friend in sadness.</p>
<p>Then, Richard fainted and fell to the floor.</p>
<p>"Richard! Richard! Wake up!"</p>
<p>Richard did not wake up. John felt for a pulse. It was not there. Richard was dead.</p>
<p>"May God shelter you, friend."</p>
<p>Richard bowed his head, closing his eyes out of respect to his good friend.</p>
<p>John jumped to his feet as he felt Richard grab at his face.</p>
<p>"Stop, Richard! You don't have to do this! Fight it!"</p>
<p>Richard wouldn't listen.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Richard, but I know you would have wanted this."</p>
<p>John aimed his pistol at Richard's forehead and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>John couldn't stay here. This place brought back memories of happier times that bothered him as much as the blood and the smell of 
the corpses. He didn't know where he would go, but he knew he had to leave.</p>
