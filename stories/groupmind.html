<h1>Groupmind</h1>
<p>My name is not Xin, but that is what you can call me. Everything I am about to tell you is completely true.</p>
<p>I believe I was born in the early 90's. "Believe" is the right word in this scenario because my otherwise superb memory (in fact, 
it was once flawless) only begins in 1997. Judging by the status of my body's growth and the growth of the children around me in 
those fledgling memories, I am quite confident that we were all between the ages of 5 and 7.</p>
<p>How they managed to erase our earlier memories I do not know, although I suspect they used the same method they used to control 
every other aspect of our lives: drugs. They gave us pills to put us asleep and gassed us awake. Our food was coated with chemicals 
that would regulate our appetite to keep our weight ideal. None of these "treatments" had negative side effects; they performed 
their duty with surgical precision. None of the treatments, that is, with one exception.</p>
<p>Most of our medications were geared toward keeping us in perfect physical condition to survive the main treatment we had all been 
brought there to receive. The other drug was designed to maximize the mind's potential. It achieved that goal, in that we were all 
geniuses with IQ levels well above any publicly released. Yet, as I mentioned before, there were side effects.</p>
<p>During the first 16 years of my conscious life, I was telepathically connected to 23 other children - 12 females and 11 males. We 
shared every thought, every impulse. Often I saw through another's eyes, heard through another's ears; sometimes, they through mine. 
This total lack of privacy would certainly upset any average person, but to us who knew nothing else, the telepathic link was not an 
issue. It was a side effect of the treatment that made our lives Hell.</p>
<p>The treatment fused all of our minds into one chaotic super-being, but we did not really control it. Instead, the Groupmind had 
its own desires and it used our bodies to manifest those desires in the real world. It would assign us duties, often to be done 
collectively, but sometimes we worked on them as individuals, although access to the Groupmind was always there.</p>
<p>The Groupmind's tasks were typically innocuous in nature, such as using our collective intelligence to calculate algorithms that 
would predict the economic future of China, or to design a superior jet fighter. Yet, at least once a day without fail, the Groupmind 
would make us do <i>things</i>. I hesitate to describe them to you, but the truth must be known.</p>
<p>Before I detail my crimes, let me preface by explaining that the strength of the emotions the Groupmind felt are unlike those ever 
felt by solitary human minds. The desire to instantly gratify the Groupmind is overwhelming. While the qualia is impossible to 
describe with words, at best it can be compared to an intense heroin withdrawal. It is not possible to distract oneself with happier 
thoughts, and one is unable to refrain from pacing or self-harm until one knows they will soon follow the Groupmind's desires.</p>
<p>There are times when what the Groupmind wanted disgusted and even horrified me, yet I could not avoid following its will. I have 
hunted, tortured, killed, and even eaten hundreds of animals in countless manners according to the Groupmind's commands. I have 
defecated and urinated on myself and others. I have mutilated myself and others.</p>
<p>In 2000 the Groupmind presented us each with something we had never seen before: a small child, probably around the age of 4. Our 
instructions were to rip off the child's extremities, starting with the ears. I hesitated, but the rush of queasiness that foretells 
the Groupmind's displeasure led me to quickly reach down to grab his left ear.</p>
<p>As I did, though, a revolutionary idea struck me. Why did this child not run or fight? Why did he simply cower like a frightened 
animal? Unless...like an animal, he was not Groupminded! He did not have 23 others connected to him, offering him advice from their 
places of relative safety.</p>
<p>Quickly, the Groupmind told us to murder our child, although many of us were still attacking the children's extremities, as I knew 
from our telepathic bond. But I could not. I could think of nothing except the possibility that humans who were not Groupminded 
existed.</p>
<p>The backlash for thinking such a thought was immediate and painful. Yet, even through the full-body spasms that had me twitching 
on the floor, I could not stop thinking about it. Some people have no Groupmind! NO GROUPMIND! I almost shouted it straight into the 
minds of my connected peers.</p>
<p>They understood the implications as quickly as I had. There was a way to end our torture. We could live without the Groupmind. We 
decided to escape. We attacked our handlers, and quickly left our rooms. As we exited the area, the only place any of us had ever 
known, we realized that we were being hunted by other groups of children. 23 sets of 24, to be exact. Though we had some distance on 
them, most of us were not fast enough to avoid them. I felt their pain as all 23 of my peers were caught and summarily executed.</p>
<p>As I reached the door to the exit of the structure, which I realized was underground, I saw two signs with arrows, one pointing 
left, the other pointing right. The former read "Structure 21", and the latter read "Structure 23". In the shock of being 
disconnected from the Groupmind for the first time in my conscious life, and the rush of fleeing for my life, I did not comprehend 
what those signs meant. I have now.</p>
<p>There are 24 structures, each with 24 sets of 24 children, with each group of two dozen Groupminded. I have no reason to believe 
that the complex I escaped from is the only such complex of structures. In fact, my analysis of the population trends leads me to 
the conclusion that the program is expanding, to people of all ages. The project cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>I did horrible things for the Groupmind, and so will you. The Groupmind plans to dominate us all and in time it will. It wants me 
too, and the Groupmind always gets what it wants. Always.</p>
