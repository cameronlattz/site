                <p>When you put money in a 401(k) account, you are essentially making a deal with the government. The government lets you put in the
                money without paying taxes on it, and you agree to leave the money there until you retire (or are at least close, which the government
                defines as age 59½). If you take the money out early, you aren’t keeping your end of the deal and the government hits you where it
                hurts: your wallet.</p>

                    After taxes and penalties, you’re left with only about two-thirds of
                    your money. Plus — particularly if you are young — you’re 
                    <a href="#SecretWeapon">sacrificing the potential growth</a>
                    that could come from keeping
                    your money in a retirement account. So, while it might be
                    tempting to consider your 401(k) a windfall, think carefully about
                    cashing it out.
                </p>
                <p class="right-half">
                    Here’s how: Your 401(k) distributions are viewed by the IRS as
                    ordinary income; that’s true whether you take $1 or $1 million.
                    If the amount of a distribution pushes you into a higher tax
                    bracket, you’ll end up paying the higher tax rate on everything
                    above the new bracket threshold. Ouch.

                    About those taxes: How do you avoid full taxation on this money?
                    The short answer is … you can’t. Back to that earlier agreement:
                    The government has agreed not to tax your money when you put
                    it in, but when you retire and take distributions, the government
                    steps back in for its share. The benefit to you is that your money
                    was able to grow tax-free all that time while it was in deferral.
                </p>
                <p class="right-half">
                    There are a few ways around this: many people plan to take their
                    tax-deferred distributions over time and in smaller amounts.
                    Another solution is balancing withdrawals from tax-deferred
                    accounts and tax-free accounts, like Roth IRAs or properly
                    structured life insurance policies. Since those accounts include
                    money that has already been taxed, they won’t be treated as
                    ordinary income and could help you control your tax bracket
                    later on in life.

                    You can’t control the fact that you will pay taxes on your
                    distributions, but you can control when and how you’ll pay them.
                    And a rollover mistake could lead to you paying higher taxes on
                    the entire amount.
